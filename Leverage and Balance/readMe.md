## Introduction

The "Lever and Balance" Unity project is designed to introduce users to fundamental physics concepts in a fun and interactive way. The simulation focuses on demonstrating how levers work and how balance is achieved in different scenarios.

## Features

- **Lever Simulation:** Experience the behavior of levers and understand how they amplify force.
- **Balance Simulation:** Explore the concept of balance and equilibrium in various scenarios.
- **Interactive Elements:** Users can interact with the levers and objects to observe real-time physics reactions.
