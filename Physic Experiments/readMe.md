# Physics Simulations in Unity

## Experiment 1: Projectile Motion

Simulate projectile motion for an object.

## Experiment 2: Collision and Energy Transfer

Display the instantaneous velocities of the objects and the force applied when they collide. After the collision, show the new velocities and directions of the objects.

## Experiment 3: Lever and Equilibrium

Design a double-armed lever. The lever should be weightless.
